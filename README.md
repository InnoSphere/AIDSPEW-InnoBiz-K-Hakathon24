# AI-Enabled Malaria Surveillance, Outbreak Prediction and Early Warning System
Welcome to the AIMSPEW official GitHub repository! AIMSPEW is an artificial intelligence-enabled malaria surveillance, outbreak prediction, and early warning system. It is designed to enable governments' health ministries, public health institutes, research institutes, and NGOs like WHO to analyze real-time malaria incidence, predict and be informed about the occurrence of a malaria outbreak, and get ready for prevention and mitigation.
Hence, this repository is the official code repository and version history of AIMSPEW.

# Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- models/: this directory contains the source code for malaria incidence prediction, climate-impact prediction, and climate-aware malaria incidence prediction AI models. The models are implemented using the TensorFlow/Keras framework and LSTM algorithm.
- backend/: this directory contains the backend code of the AIMSPEW system, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Django framework and Java using the Spring Boot framework.
- frontend/: this directory contains the frontend code for the AIMSPEW system, implemented using React, and Redux.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the AIMSPEW system. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.
